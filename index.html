<h1>HOW TO: Tie a Figure Eight Follow-Through Knot</h1>

		<h2>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</h2>
		<h3>What is this knot even good for?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>A figure eight follow-through knot creates a secure, non-slip loop at the end of a rope.</p>
			<p>It is an excellent way to attach something (or someone) to a length of rope, and it is commonly used by rock climbers and mountaineers as a way "tie in" to a safety point.</p>
		</div>	
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>What do I need to get started?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>A length of rope at least 6 feet long.</p>
		</div>
		<br>

</div>
<br>

<h2>STEP-BY-STEP</h2>
<div>	
	<h3>1. Grab a length of rope about three feet from the end.</h3> 
	<div style="width: 100%;"><img src="img/tail.gif" width="50%" align="middle"></div>
	<div>
		<p>Three feet is roughly the distance between your hand and your nose when your arm is fully outstretched. We'll we working with the "tail end" of the rope, and we'll call the other end the "standing end."</p>
	</div>	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	<h3>2. Now wrap the tail end completely around the standing end until it forms a loop, then push the tail end through the loop you just created.</h3> 
	<div style="width: 100%;"><img src="img/2thru5.gif" width="50%" align="middle"></div>
	<div>
		<p>If it helps, you can imagine wrapping a scarf around a snowman&rsquo;s head, then sticking a carrot right in the middle of his nose!</p>
	</div>	
</div>
<br>
<div>
	<h3>3. When you pull the tail end all the way through your loop, the resulting knot should look like a figure 8. </h3>
	<div style="width: 100%;"><img src="img/pull.gif" width="50%" align="middle"></div>
	<div>	
		<p>If your knot looks like a pretzel instead of a figure 8, you probably didn&rsquo;t wrap the scarf all the way around your snowman. To fix this, just untie the knot and start over, making sure you wrap the tail end ALL the way around the standing end.</p>
	</div>	
</div>
<br>
<dir>
	<h3>4. Starting from the shorter strand coming out of the bottom of the knot, retrace the figure eight using the tail end of the rope.</h3> 
	<div style="width: 100%;"><img src="img/789.gif" width="50%" align="middle"></div>
	<div>
		<p>This part is tricky, so pay close attention to whether the tail needs to run along the left or the right side of the rope, or on the inside or outside of each loop. If it helps, you can imagine that the figure eight knot is a loopy roller coaster track, and the tail end is the roller coaster: the coaster needs to follow along parallel on the track and it should never jump on/off/over the track.</p> 
		<p><i>A LITTLE TIP</i>: If you are having a hard time with the follow-through, try loosening your figure eight knot so that the tail end has more space as it retraces the knot.</p>
	</div>	
</dir>
<br>
<div>
	<h3>5. Now your knot should look like a neat, woven figure eight, and it should lay nice and flat!</h3>
	<div style="width: 100%;"><img src="img/10.jpg" width="50%" align="middle"></div> 
	<div>
		<p>If your knot is tangled and/or will not lay flat, you probably need to re-do the follow-through portion.</p>
